Empowering Democracy with blockchain: A New Age Polling System

This project offers an innovative attempt to modernize the democratic voting process in
response to the current demand for safe and transparent voting. With the use of Ethereum
blockchain smart contracts written in Solidity, the project hopes to build a safe, open, and
effective system. Resolving shortcomings in conventional voting methods, the plan aims to bring
in a new phase of democratic participation. The suggested voting system creates a strong basis
by utilizing the intrinsic qualities of blockchain, especially its immutability and transparency. This
satisfies the fundamental requirement for reliable democratic procedures in the digital era.
